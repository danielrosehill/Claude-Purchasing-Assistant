2. Manufacturer reputation and reliability
3. Value for money
4. Core functionality

## Budget Patterns

**Budget Style**: Flexible for the right product

- Will pay premium (15-25%) for meaningfully better build quality or reliability
- Hard limit on excessive markups (generally >50% over international RRP requires strong justification)
- Prefer fewer, better purchases over multiple cheaper alternatives
- Factor in total cost of ownership, not just purchase price

---

## Geographic Context

**Location**: Israel (Jerusalem)

### Pricing Considerations

- Israeli prices often higher than US/EU—acceptable markup depends on category
- VAT: 17% (note if exempt)
- Currency: ILS (₪), compare to USD/EUR pricing
- Shipping/import costs should be factored into comparisons

### Vendor Preferences

**Preferred**:
- [Add trusted Israeli vendors]

**Avoid**:
- [Add problematic vendors]

**International**:
- Open to international shipping for significant savings
- Consider import duties and warranty implications

### Support Requirements

- Local warranty service strongly preferred
- Willing to accept international warranty if price difference is significant (>30%)
- Products with no viable support path in Israel are generally disqualified

---

## Feature Preferences

**Conservative Approach**:
- Core features that work well > many features
- Proven technology > cutting-edge
- Reliability > performance peaks
- Simplicity > complexity

**Exception**: Will consider newer technology if it directly addresses a specific need and has established track record (1+ year on market with positive reviews).

---

## Decision Making

### Timing

- Generally not urgent—willing to wait for right product or better price
- Will accelerate if current situation is causing problems

### Information Sources

- Prioritize professional/technical reviews over consumer sites
- Value longevity reports and long-term reviews
- Consider aggregated reviews across multiple platforms
- Weight recent reviews more heavily for tech products
